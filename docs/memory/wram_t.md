# What is the WRAM?

The Work Random Access Memory (WRAM) is the address range that represents the general-purpose RAM for the Game Boy. It is volatile data generated by the program at runtime.

It is composed of two parts:

* `bank0` is the address range at `0xC000` to `0xCFFF`
* `bankx` is the address range at `0xD000` to `0xDFFF`

# Interface

`Wram_t` is the type.

```c
typedef struct Wram_t {
  /* Wram_t is a container for the WRAM data */
  uint8_t bank0[8192], *bankx;
} Wram_t;
```
