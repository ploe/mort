# What is a symfile?

A symfile is a file containing a list of `labels`, `banks` and `addresses` generated by the linking process. Collectively, this information is a `symbol`

The format is used in a lot of Game Boy tools and emulators. Hence why it is also used here.

# Types

## Symbol_t

`Symbol_t` is a type that contains the elements of a parsed symbol.

`address` is the location that the symbol points to.

`bank` is the MBC bank where the address is located.

`label` is the name we use for the symbol. This is a label in the assembly code.

```c
typedef struct Symbol_t {
  /* Symbol_t is a container for a parsed Symfile symbol */
  uint16_t address;
  uint8_t bank;
  char label[MAX_SYMFILE_LABEL_LENGTH];
} Symbol_t;
```

## Symfile_t

`Symfile_t` is a type that contains all the parsed symbols of a symfile.

`mask` is a bitmask for the indices of the `symbols` array, and also acts as its length.

`symbols` is a dynamically allocated array of parsed symbols.

```c
typedef struct Symfile_t {
  /* Symfile_t is a hash map of the parsed Symfile symbols */
  unsigned long mask;
  Symbol_t *symbols;
} Symfile_t;
```
